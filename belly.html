<h3>Belly dance is an expressive dance which emphasizes complex movements of the torso. Originally a Middle Eastern folk dance, it has evolved to take many different forms depending on the country and region, both in costume and dance style. New styles have been spread from the Middle East to the whole world where its popularity has becoming more and more popular in the Occident.<br>

The term "belly dance" is a translation of the French term "danse du ventre", which was applied to the dance in the Victorian era, and probably originally referred to dancers from the Ouled Nail tribes of Algeria. Its current use is something of a misnomer, as the Ouled Nail dance used more abdominal movements than the dances described today as "belly dance".

In Arabic, the dance is known as Raqs Sharqi ("Eastern Dance") or Raqs Baladi ("Country Dance" or "Folk Dance").<br>

Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips.[2] Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.

In common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognised.<br>
